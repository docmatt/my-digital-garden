> [!success]- **World Details**
> - [[Specularum\|Specularum]]
> - First two weeks of Ambyrmont, AC 999. 
> - **Weather**: Clear, dry, cool (early autumn)
 
> [!example]- **Previous Notes** 
> - [[Session Notes/The Other Guys/Other Guys - 03-26-2025#^013aa3\|Other Guys - 26th March 2025]]

> [!todo]- **This Session**
> - Mostly spent as 'what we do during two weeks of down time'
> - [[PCs/The Other Guys/Larisa\|Larisa]] noted that she and her halfling NPC (*still no name?! -- Editor's note*) and gets [[The Elvenguard\|Ducal guards]] to arrest the [[Factions/The Veiled Society\|Veiled Society]] and wharf workers and secure the wine house.
> 	- Turns out they kind of slacked off on that as [[PCs/The Other Guys/Everidge\|Everidge]]'s later investigations demonstrated that the Society had re-established operations within the building.
> - Two weeks downtime happens
> 	- Can't remember what everyone else did individually, but..
> 		- [[PCs/The Other Guys/Fensbit Fapplebit\|Fensbit]] started work on the [[_Quick Note/Enflaminator\|Enflaminator]] mk2, tentatively renamed as the **Mincinerator**.
> 			- It's a hand-held flame-creating device with a long enough range to take the hassle out of a [[Specularum\|Specularum]] lamplighter's tiresome but essential work.
> 			- And - as a special added extra - potentially hot enough to rapidly heat small hand-sized mince pies or mince rolls for a handy snack while they're on the job.
> 			- **See also**: ==Gnome Construction Skills== (*PC2 Top Balista, p.34*)
> 	- As a group though...
> 		 - We looked into where the red/purple candle messages were being sent to/from
> 		 - We identified a collection of 6 common 'originating' sites
> 		 - Two were identified for each of the three key merchant factions in [[Specularum\|Specularum]] - that is the [[Radu Family\|Radu Family]], [[Torenescu Family\|Torenescu Family]], and the [[Vorloi Family\|Vorloi Family]]
> 		 - The [[Radu Family\|Radu Family]] sites were all within a Radu dominated section of the city.
> 		 - The two sites in that area were a ==money lender== and a ==bakery==.
> 		 - We threw around a lot of ideas, including trying to infiltrate both sites,
> 		 - In the end, [[PCs/The Other Guys/Larisa\|Larisa]] cast *[[Invisibility\|Invisibility]]* on the NPC thief (*also without a name, just like the halfling! - Editor's note*) and spent several nights in the first week watching a room above the baker's.
> 			 - It turns out that several people appeared at approximately the same time most nights (?teleport) and then send a signal using the filters for the candles and then disappear again.
> 			 - The rooms have no entrances/exits except for the second story windows the thief gained entrance through.
> 			 - The signals were all pre-memorised and an *[[ESP\|ESP]]* spell cast on some of the signallers indicates that the signallers themselves don't understand the codes they're sending.
> 			 - There is a two part key that allows them to appear and disappear once their work is done - a hand-held device that they hold and a wall-situated sigil in the room.
> 			 - When we investigated the room we noticed the signals in located opposite [[PCs/The Other Guys/Larisa\|Larisa]]'s house, we discovered the same sort of arrangement.
> 			 - While we investigated that house, Larisa was able to identify one of the signallers as a student at the [[Specularum Magicians' Guild\|Specularum Magicians' Guild]] of about the same skill level as her.
>  - The plan going forward was to find her and press her for more information when the game resumes next week.
