> [!tldr]- **Session Notes**
> - Went back to the wine merchant's shop, to enter and explore it, and meet with the wine merchant on our terms rather than his
> - Entered the shop by forcing our way in through the front door - slept or knocked out the guard on the front door to do so.
> 	- There were lots of strange curiousity items in the front room (as well as wine related items of course)
> 	- Amongst them was a 'Rubixo Cube' (metallic / bronze crafted) - a cube with 3x3 labelled blocks on each side
> 	- The labels were elemental symbols on the sides, six different type.
> 	- The cube had been solved.
> 	- Taken by [[PCs/The Other Guys/Fensbit Fapplebit\|Fensbit]]
> - Wine merchant was found dead in a basement level room of his shop.
> 	- The room was setup as a torture room.
> 	- The merchant had been killed (recently) by blunt and piercing trauma (alas, poor Yorick - or whatever your name was - we knew you not well at all).
> 	- He had a purple robe - a member of the [[Factions/The Veiled Society\|Veiled Society]] most likely?
> 	- We found a secret door panel leading away from this room - quite a long corridor leading away from it.
> 	- [[PCs/The Other Guys/Fensbit Fapplebit\|Fensbit]] and [[PCs/The Other Guys/Everidge\|Everidge]] moved along it to explore and were caught in a *[[Silence 15' Radius\|silenced]]* area of the corridor.
> 	- When we tried to turn back we found an force wall blocking out exit.
> 	- As we tried to get out of it there was a small flame trap that ignited causing some minor damage to us.
> 	- We moved to the end of the corridor, found a door, [[PCs/The Other Guys/Everidge\|Everidge]] busted it open, and we emerged into the yard at the back of the house!
> - As we moved back around to the front to meetup with the rest of the party, we spotted a group of docks workers gathering outside the wine merchant's house.
> 	- They were intending to kill [[PCs/The Other Guys/Larisa\|Larisa]]'s halfling associate (*Who is probably by now currently demanding at least a name* *equal billing in this game! Halflings are just the worst -- Editor's Note*).
> 	- They also wanted to capture all of us.
> 	- We smacked them upside the head(s) and dragged them inside, despite [[PCs/The Other Guys/Larisa\|Larisa]] wanting to kill them then and there.
> - By this time, the front room guard was waking up.
> 	- We questioned him.
> 	- He was surprised to hear his boss the wine merchant was dead - he'd only seen him an hour or so earlier and he was in perfect health.
> 	- He told us that he'd been upstairs all night and hadn't seen anyone but us enter or exit the premises.
> 	- He noted there were three exits from the house though (all locked from the outside).
> 	- He indicated the entire group was part of the [[Factions/The Veiled Society\|Veiled Society]] and the Society had corrupted the loyalty of extensive parts of the city guard.
> 	- He wasn't as certain about the Society's control of elite units like the Elven Guard of the [[NPCs/Duke Stefan Karameikos\|Duke]].
> 	- He didn't know too much else - except that the Society was planning something big.
> 	- He seemed to be a very uninformed and likely low level member of the Society.
> - ? Did these folks try to assassinate Torenescu? Larisa said something about this when questioning the front door guard.
> 	- Later it was confirmed (I think) that the 'Torenescu' the Society thugs had intended to assassinate was [[Alexander Torenescu\|Alexander Torenescu]].
> - We also confirmed it is the Society who is using a signalling system within [[Specularum\|Specularum]] that relies on ==purple and red== filtered candles in various places around the city.{ #013aa3}
