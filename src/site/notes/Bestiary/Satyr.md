> - **Magic pipes:** One satyr in a group has magic pipes and may play them when encountered for one of the following effects:
>	**a. Charm:** Used on attractive individuals. Anyone within 60’ who hears the song must save versus spells or be [[Spells/Magical Spells/1st Level Magical Spells/Charm Person\|charmed]]: move towards the satyr (resisting those who try to prevent it); defend the satyr; obey the satyr’s commands (if understood); unable to cast spells or use magic items; unable to harm the satyr. A character who saves is unaffected for the rest of the encounter. Killing the satyr breaks the charm.
>	**b. Fear:** Used on powerful enemies. All within 60’ must save versus spells or flee for 2 turns.
>	**c. Sleep:** Used against intruders not deemed dangerous. All within 60’ must ==save versus spells== or fall asleep for 4d4 (`dice: 4d4`) turns. Satyrs will rob sleeping victims.
