> [!info]- **Notes**
> This is a magical monster with the head, wings, and legs of a rooster and the tail of a snake. Its beak attack causes **`dice:1d6`** points of damage. Any creature bitten or touched by a cockatrice must make a saving throw or be turned to stone. Cockatrices may be found anywhere. 
> 
> **Plane of Earth:** On the plane of Earth, a cockatrice is a foot-long birdlike creature made of soft earth. It is nearly harmless, able to inflict only **1** point of damage with a beak attack. Its touch can still petrify a creature not made of earth (the saving throw still applies). Cockatrices breed normally on their own plane.
