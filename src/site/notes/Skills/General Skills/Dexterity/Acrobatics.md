>> [!info]- **Description / Notes**
>>  ###### The character with this skill can perform impressive acrobatic feats, balance on taut ropes and wires, etc. Many entertainers, thieves, and nimble warriors have this skill.
>>  
>>  - A successful skill roll is required to perform any acrobatic feat; failure may result in the character falling. 
>>  - A successful roll allows a character to reduce the effective height of a fall by 10'.
>>  - A DM can give an acrobatic character a + 2 to save vs. mechanical traps where agility would help - such as tilting floors and pit traps.
>>  
>>  This skill is **not** the equal of a mystic's acrobatics ability, but the mystic's special ability can be presumed to include this skill; a mystic does not have to purchase the acrobatics skill.
