>> ###### The character knows how to raise, train, and care for one type of animal.
>> 
>> - The animal can be taught some simple tricks or simple orders.
>>  
>> A character who wants to train two or more different animal types must choose this skill more than once - **Horse Training** is one skill, **Dog Training** is another. However, a horse trainer can train any sort of natural horse or pony and a dog trainer can train any breed of dog.
>> 
>> Any culture that features a strong bond with some animal type will have many members with the corresponding **Animal Training** skill.
