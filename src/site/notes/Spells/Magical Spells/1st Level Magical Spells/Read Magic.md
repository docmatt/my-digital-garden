>>Allows the caster to decipher magical script or runes, as follows:
>> - **Scrolls:** The magical script of a scroll of arcane spells can be understood. The caster is then able to activate the scroll at any time in the future.
>> - **Spell books:** A spell book written by another arcane spell caster can be deciphered.
>> - **Inscriptions:** Runes or magical words inscribed on an object or surface can be understood.
>> - **Reading again:** Once the caster has used this spell to decipher a magical inscription, they can always understand that script again without _read magic_.
